# AlgorithmicTrading
Using the Zerodha KiteConnect API platform to build an algorithmic market/exchange trading program template.
This does not contain any strategic algorithms.

This template will allow you to build your own Algorithmic Trading Program.
This template uses a Third Party API i.e. Zerodha's KiteConnect API (Python), as such to use this program you will need
Zerodha's KiteConnect API License.
This Project is not related to Zerodha's development team. I am using this project for experience and as a hobby.
