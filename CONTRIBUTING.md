This project is a Hobbby project of mine to get further experience in Python, Webhooks and use of third party API to
create a template for Algorithmic Trading.

Anyone may use the template as is, or may make modifications as per their convenience, but I do not take any liability.
This project will not be completed wholly. As in the main strategic algorithm that decides actions will not be included 
and will have to be done by yourself.

As this is a hobby project as well as an expereince for me, it will be a solo project.
If there are suggestion or criticisms please do leave them, but please adhere to the code of conduct while doing so.

The end result of this project is for a complete Trading program to be created ,but I will only post/commit the changes which
do not have any strategic algorithms in them.

This base is free for anyone to use, but please adhere to the MIT Open Source License.

Thank you all for undertsading this and adhering to these requests.
